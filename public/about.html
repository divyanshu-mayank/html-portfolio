<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>A 21-year-old Production Engineering student at NIT Agartala, 
  I'm on a mission to bridge the gap between circuits and code.</p>

<p>I've spent the past year diving headfirst into Data Structures & Algorithms, 
  sharpening my competitive programming skills, 
  and even experimenting with the wonders of web development. 
  When I'm not in the lab or hammering away at my keyboard, 
  you'll find me capturing moments through photography, 
  busting a move on the dance floor, 
  or chasing the next adventure. 
  Friendly and outgoing, 
  I love connecting with others and sharing a laugh over a friendly game of basketball. 
  Let's chat, code, or conquer the next challenge together!</p>
